## OVERVIEW

### THE CHALLENGE

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for validation error should say *"Enter an valid email address"*
  - A password strength meter. It should validate the following rules:
        ○ minimal length of 8 characters
        ○ should contain at least one special character
        ○ one number
        ○ one uppercase letter
        ○ one lowercase letter
